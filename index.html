                Baby ukw, sometimes I find myself lost in thoughts of you, realizing how much space you've taken in my heart without even trying...
                Your name feels like a prayer, your smile like magic, and your presence – even in its simplest form – gives me a peace I never knew I needed.
                You’re the most <b>beautiful</b> part of my life, the reason behind my smiles, and the person my heart constantly beats for.
                Loving you feels like breathing—natural, effortless, and essential.
                I just want to remind you today how truly precious you are to me.
                You’re not just someone I care about; you’re my <b>whole world</b> in one person.
                I love you endlessly, <span class="highlight-name">Priyanshi</span>… always.
                <span class="icon">💖</span>
            </p>

                You are the reason behind my calm,<br>
                The sweetest melody in life’s softest song.<br>
                A heart so pure, a soul so bright,<br>
                With you, everything just feels right.<br><br>

                In your smile, I find my day,<br>
                In your voice, my worries fade away.<br>
                No words can capture what I feel,<br>
                But know this love is forever real.<br><br>

                So never doubt, not even for a while,<br>
                You’re my peace, my joy, my constant smile.<br>
                I loved you yesterday, I’ll love you more today,<br>
                And tomorrow, my love will find a new way.
